# Short Stories Landing page

Short Stories Landing page is a landing page for the mobile app Short Stories project. This project is used for the promotion of curated short literature stories of public domain and contemporary authors.

## Getting Started

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the index.html file in your web browser.
